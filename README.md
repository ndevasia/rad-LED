# rad-LED

HackMIT 2019 project by Jake Whitton, Mayukha Vadari, and Nisha Devasia.

Objective of the game is to control a blue "player" pixel down the length of an LED strip while strategically fighting off of enemies to get to the end goal - the green pixel at the end of the strip!

Player has two modes:
- Regular mode, where the player is allowed to attack by holding the one button.
- Recharge mode, where the player is allowed to recharge by holding the B button. 

Controller is a sideways Wii remote.
Controls:
- D-pad down on Wiimote: move right (inverted because Wiimote is used sideways)
- D-pad up on Wiimote: move up (inverted because Wiimote is used sideways)
- One button: hold to attack, but after key press is registered, player is locked out of attacking for four more moves
- Two button: hold to switch player modes
- B: hold to recharge while in recharge mode

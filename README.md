HackMIT 2019 project by Jake Whitton, Mayukha Vadari, and Nisha Devasia.

You play as our valiant hero, the blue pixel! Your goal is to fight off the evil gremlins (the roving white pixels) on the battlefield that are between you and your goal, Castle Green (the green pixel). 

Player has two modes:
- Regular mode, where the player is allowed to attack by holding the one button.
- Recharge mode, where the player is allowed to recharge by holding the B button. However, if the player gets attacked in this mode, they are instantly dead.

Controller is a sideways Wii remote.
Controls:
- D-pad down on Wiimote: move right (inverted because Wiimote is used sideways)
- D-pad up on Wiimote: move up (inverted because Wiimote is used sideways)
- One button: hold to attack, but after key press is registered, player is locked out of attacking for four more moves
- Two button: hold to switch player modes
- B: hold to recharge while in recharge mode
